               <div class="main_text2_line3">People just went to the company to work; there was basically no fun at the office since we had projects after projects. Serious projects, too, with really high stakes, since those are from the government, and you would be less likely to receive a next one if you had done badly on a previous one. Outside of work, though, we had many meals together, met up for picnics, and went on holidays. We even had a soccer team, which I tried to attend whenever I could. I really enjoyed those social interactions.</div>

                <div class="main_text3_line3">Sometimes, when an ex-employee moved to a different company. Our company was incredibly busy all the time, and many people could not handle the stress. I still contact some of them today. But other than that, no.</div>

               <div class="main_text2_line2">How about the clients? What were the interactions like?</div>
               <div class="main_text2_line3">We usually had a team of 4 or more people to meet clients to collect data or ask if they had any other demands and changes. Those data were on paper, and there were so many stacks of paper that they could not be moved, so we had to come to their place. Usually, within this team of 4 or more people, there would be 1 or 2 people from the Technical department. Both our company and our clients avoided meeting outside of working hours, since it was (and still is) sensitive to meet government officials after work. Sometimes, though, their office would contact and provide us accommodation, since our company worked with governments in different provinces. I went with my team to Nha Trang and Da Nang, for example, so we stayed at a hotel for a couple of months. We even had a designated driver, who was really helpful.</div>

                <div class="main_text3_line1">Fourth Question</div>
                <div class="main_text3_line2">What aspects of your work do you spend the most time on?</div>
                <div class="main_text3_line3">This actually depended on different periods of the project. In one period you would spend all day analyzing the data collected, and in the next you would be designing a database based on your analyses and the clients’ demands. You could also be coding or fixing code for other members of your team. So, I would say that it depends on the development phases of a project, and even between projects as well.</div>

               <div class="main_text2_line1">Fifth Question</div>
               <div class="main_text2_line2">Which aspects posed the most challenge for you??</div>
               <div class="main_text2_line3">I would say that coding was troubling. Not because of its difficulty, but mainly because if there was any miscommunication at all, or if any analyses were wrong, a whole bunch of code must be changed, fixed, or even discarded. Especially when there were various people working on the same code, fixing them might be troublesome. Also, there were many times when you and your team had a brilliant idea, but then it could not be done because the clients had changed their demands, and someone forgot to mention these changes to the technical team. So, I would say that miscommunications during coding were really annoying to me. However, you need to be patient during those situations. Everyone makes mistakes. Getting angry and blaming people do not help your team, and if you are angry you would not make the best product in your ability, whether it was code or not. Working as a leader for many teams taught me to be patient with other people and defuse heated situations. IT people should learn those skills, even if they do not want to be a leader, since it would make them better teammates</div>

                <div class="main_text3_line1">Sixth Question</div>
                <div class="main_text3_line2">Could you pick out an example of your work to be the essence of the IT industry?</div>
                <div class="main_text3_line3">Unfortunately, the nature of my work, and the company, was really discreet. Those were done during the early days, when the government wanted to digitize their databases, so obviously they did not want anyone to share or know too many details, except for the companies working on it. I will say this, though. IT work was, and still is, group work through and through. Not only were you required to work with your team – which could change between projects – but you were also required to work with different teams during a project. For example, the business team or the analyst team.</div>

               <div class="main_text2_line2">Which one did you like better?</div>
               <div class="main_text2_line3">I liked the business team, since they negotiated a better pay for our products. They liked us too since we worked and produced programs and made any changes possible. So, most of our clients were really pleased, since most, if not all, of the changes that they wanted were satisfied. In return, this made the next negotiations easier.</div>
